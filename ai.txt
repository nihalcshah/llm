	My main purpose of this podcast was to address the misconception that AI has the ability to become sentient. Of course, this discourse has taken over a lot of the news and general public, but people uninformed about AI are subject to pop culture and mass media perpetuating AI as something that can easily just gain sentience. My audience was this group of people that was affected by the mass hysteria and was unknowledgeable about AI and the way it works. I started my podcast with a 10 second segment of news clips talking about AI continuously compounding over and over to create a mess. The segment ended with 3 AI voices saying “Let’s talk about AI.” I used this to help represent the mass hysteria about AI that has been presented in popular media. I used stock sound effects to help transition between my speaking moments. At times, it may sound funny, but it lightens the mood and serves to make the speaking less boring and monotonous, and also allows for a transition between different points, a problem I feel I had in my previous podcast. 
I used the soundtrack of Tron to help give a techno-futuristic feel and drama to the podcast’s speaking. The ending music is more dramatic when I conclude the talk about AI. I utilize the time after I explain the misconception to define what AI is (00:42). I also allow myself to create the key point of my argument, that AI is representative of the data used to train it. I use sources from articles talking about Tech to make my point. However, along with this, I establish my credibility for explaining how Artificial Intelligence works by stating that I, myself, am an AI/ML engineer. This allows me to freely talk about and explain AI through personal experience and knowledge.
