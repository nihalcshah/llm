The “IST and Stem Majors” Podcast focuses on the misconception that being an IST major leads to a lack of real world opportunities or an easy way out compared to the struggles of being an Engineering major. The host, Emanuel, asserts that the college of IST is often seen as a limiting factor, or a secondary choice to the College of Engineering, and the purpose of the podcast is to disprove this very notion. Emanuel, through the use of personal anecdotes from students in IST programs as well as refutations through the testimony of students in the college of Engineering, Emanuel works to dispel the misconceptions of the IST majors for students thinking of applying.
The first piece that Emanuel focuses on is getting testimony from IST students specifically. This provides credibility, as he is using external sources that support his claims. These IST students not only mention why they currently enjoy being in the College of IST, but also share how they ended up as IST majors, which allows for the audience to understand the specific differences between Engineering and IST. 
Furthermore, through the use of testimony from the Computer Science major, Emanuel redefines the College of IST as more practical compared to the theory-heavy engineering majors, rather than simply being easier. This allows for the audience to take in expert testimony without worry of bias, as this student is not in the college of IST, but still believes that the college is useful and deserving of merit. Emanuel ties this all back together by reframing the argument in terms of his target audience, imploring the incoming students that are considering the College of IST to not be influenced by these misconceptions.
