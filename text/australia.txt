Introduction and Background
The economy falls lower and lower. People fill the streets as the unemployment rate goes up. As more and more people fall into poverty, the state of our nation falls into despair with the value of an Australian dollar declining rapidly. The Commonwealth of Australia understands the long term effects of quantitative easing. Nations all over the world were and are still dealing with recessions and struggled to find a genuine solution to the problems at hand. With global trade tensions high, it was already difficult for countries to maintain their GDP. With monetary hardships hitting nations hard, many sought to use quantitative easing to temporarily fix the issues. Despite the temporary growth in the economy, quantitative easing led to the devaluation of domestic currency, affecting many civilians. The priority of the IMF should be the deflating of the economy and helping the people critically impacted by the implications of quantitative easing.

The Commonwealth of Australia on Dealing with Quantitative Easing
The Commonwealth of Australia has more often than not looked towards quantitative easing to solve the economic problems our nation has had in the past. Australia has recently attempted to shift towards other policies but we are still dealing with some of the more long term effects of quantitative easing. Relative to many of the other countries in the UN, Australia is decently well off and was able to relatively slow the economic downturn caused due to the global pandemic using methods other than quantitative easing. However, due to a recent increase in the unemployment rate, Australia was forced into using quantitative easing once again. The Commonwealth of Australia desires alternatives to quantitative easing that can be used to resolve the issues of a slowly falling economy. It also looks to the IMF for aid in the form of policy to deal with the massive inflation of currency in many countries due to quantitative easing. The Commonwealth of Australia, through the IMF, seeks to better its economy with aid and relatively more substantial global fiscal policies and trade growth.ww

Possible Solutions
The Commonwealth of Australia believes that while there are many possible approaches to solving this issue, many approaches may lead to further economic downturn and the problem should be solved from the root. We firmly believe that a step in the right direction involves trade reform and Australia proposes that the IMF enact a joint partnership plan with the WTO to facilitate trade between nations, utilizing bilateral trade agreements. In terms of short term fiscal solutions, Australia believes that the IMF should design a registry with corporations large economic worth in specific countries and inject money into the stream directly through helicopter drops given to these companies and investors. If necessary, the Commonwealth of Australia recognizes the need for austerity through increased taxation and less severe trade tariffs.
