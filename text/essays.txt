Breathless, falling, reaching up but…  s p i r a l i n g.  I need this stress to stop. My goal is to be like a man by the sea, waves coming and going but the man remains still. I started with deep breaths. Simply regulating my heart rate allowed me to retain my composure. My stress needs to be tamed, out of not weakness, but necessity. My colleagues rely on me and my work, meaning it has to be done with a clear head. Working to destress takes time. However, if I can slowly  detach the outcomes from my efforts, I can find the optimal balance for my hard work. By practicing this mindfulness through meditation, I can overcome the stress, and be the man by the sea – calm, resilient, and content.

In high school, I had set a goal to design a weapons detection system in order to reduce the risk of active shooter situations. I’ve since made progress on this. I have developed an algorithm to detect guns in photos from their heat signatures. Using generative AI, I can mimic images for a dataset. However, I lack the resources to perform such a computationally expensive task, as I need to simulate a large amount of data with a high level of accuracy. For this, I require resources for computing either through my university and professors or through grants. If I can secure these over the next few months. I should be able to train a model for weapons detection.

There’s no way they expect me to do this. I stared at the cow dung and could feel myself throw up a little. Dung bricks have one problem – they need to be handcrafted. Yeah, and my animal hospital volunteering team of three years was invited to make them. It was the smell that hit first. Repulsed, I had to force myself to sit down and mold the bricks. A friend explained, “Wouldn’t it be satisfying to finally see the hospital fully built?” And the smell of cow dung wasn’t pleasant, but I let it go, setting aside my revulsion for the greater cause. Looking ahead, if I can apply the same humility in my volunteering at Virginia Tech, I can build up my community, brick by brick.

Virginia Tech’s Principles of Community supports access and inclusion by affirming the dignity and value of every person, respecting differences, promoting mutual understanding and open expression, and strives to eliminate bias and discrimination. Reflect on a time when you were not able or allowed to express a different or diverse position or opinion (or you witnessed another person or group experience the same situation)? How did you respond or wish you would have responded? Did your viewpoint change in any way after this experience? (700 characters)

Doors are so important, because no one likes talking to a wall. Yet, that’s what happens at my family’s dining table. My uncle was amidst a diatribe about a company that hired members of a certain background, and was voicing his discontent. The topic starts as a joke, but it always spirals… and then the yelling starts. This disagreement stemmed from a divergence in morals and experience. It was my uncle, a realist, his opinion based on the cases he’s seen over 50 years. It was me, an idealist, adhering to my values. By acknowledging this, we unearthed the crux of the issue. Highlighting this fundamental disagreement opened the door to understanding each other’s viewpoint. 

Share a time when you were most proud of yourself either as a role model or when you displayed your leadership. What specific skills did you contribute to the experience? How did others rely on you for guidance? What did you learn about yourself during this time? (700 characters)

Yes, I’m crazy. Yes, I’m out of my mind. Or… at least that’s what my sponsor called me when I proposed designing a website for thousands of people to rush onto to buy tickets for our school’s biggest event. So there I was, the leader of a team of students. Terrifying, right? The task was rough and the key to success was organization. Each member of the team had specific tasks, and they required testing on each aspect of their code. Overseeing this task as well as creating my own code required a heavy amount of communication and coordination amongst the team. Ultimately, the structuring was what pushed my team forward, propelling us to set a tradition with the site for years to come.
